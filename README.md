# h132: Experimental Secret Information Management System

**h132** is an experimental secret information management system written in Go.
It leverages affordable, tamper-resistant hardware modules such as **TPM 2.0** and **FIDO2 Security Keys** to provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

The name "h132" is derived from the Japanese word for "secret," **ç§˜å¯† (himitsu)** ðŸ˜‰ 

## Important Notice

This project is highly experimental. Before considering its use, it is *strongly recommended* to explore established tools like [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) and [age](https://age-encryption.org/). While they doesn't support the proposed multi-factor encryption scheme, they are arguably much safer than relying on an experimental software.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Effective Solution:** Operates on a Raspberry Pi with a total cost under 20,000 JPY.
- **Tamper-Resistant Security:** Employs TPM 2.0 and FIDO2 Security Keys to ensure robust protection of encryption keys.
- **Secure Key Management:**
  - Generates encryption keys directly on the TPM 2.0 module.
  - Access keys are **not stored** on any of the devices; instead, they are dynamically generated using key material derived from [HMAC-secret](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-ps-20210615/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-ps-errata-20220621.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension) via FIDO2 Security Keys.
- **Multi-Factor Secret Recovery:** Requires the following components to recover secrets:
  1. An **encrypted repository**.
  2. A hardware module connected to **TPM 2.0**.
  3. A **FIDO2 Security Key**.
  4. The **PIN** for the FIDO2 Security Key.
- **Emergency Recovery Mechanism:** Provides a "recovery phrase" to derive an emergency decryption key in case of hardware failure.

## How It Works

### At Highlevel

1. **Access Key Generation:**
   - Secret access keys are generated and securely stored within the TPM 2.0 module.
2. **Access Key Access Secret Derivation:**
   - A salt value is sent to the FIDO2 Security Key, which generates an HMAC-secret.
   - This HMAC-secret is processed through a key derivation function to produce the access secret.
3. **Symmetric Encryption Key Retrieval:**
   - The access key is used to decrypt symmetric encryption key, used to encrypt the file content.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (or any hardware that runs Linux)
    - Due to the nature of this system, it is highly recommended to set up a dedicated Linux environment.
- TPM 2.0 Module
    - OPTIGAâ„¢ TPM 2.0 Explorer clone module [GeeekPi Raspberry Pi TPM2.0ãƒ¢ã‚¸ãƒ¥ãƒ¼ãƒ« TPM9670](https://amzn.asia/d/0k4sycS) is available under 3400 JPY.
    - You can use a TPM emulator like [swtpm](https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm), but its use would defeat the purpose of the system.
- FIDO2 Security Key that supports `hmac-secret` extension
    - [Yubico Security Key](https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/) is available under 7000 JPY
    - Be careful when purchasing Security Key. Not all FIDO2 keys support the `hmac-secret` extension.
